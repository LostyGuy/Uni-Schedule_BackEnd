# iss (issuer): Issuer of the JWT
# sub (subject): Subject of the JWT (the user)
# aud (audience): Recipient for which the JWT is intended
# exp (expiration time): Time after which the JWT expires
# iat (issued at time): Time at which the JWT was issued; can be used to determine age of the JWT
# jti (JWT ID): Unique identifier; can be used to prevent the JWT from being replayed (allows a token to be used only once)
